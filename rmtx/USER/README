---------- HOW TO RECOMPILE and INSTALL user mode programs -------------

1. To compile and install a user mode program, e.g. test.c
   Run  mku test 
2. To recompile and install ALL in this directory:
   Run  mkallu

------------------- OR: Run make on the Makefile -----------------------
3. To re-compile and install ALL user mode programs in THIS directory:

   Run    makeall

which makes all the binary executables into the bin/ directory and then
install them to PARTITION 3 of VMware VM's IDE hard disk.

4. If needed, modify the PARTITION# in the vmware-mount line (3 for now) 
   to the desired partition.
