Installation
============

0) Requirements

   0.1) Setting the 64/32-bits Linux compilation environment

   Make sure you have the environment properly set up:

   $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libc6-dev-i386  

   0.2) Installing native AdaCore GNAT compiler

   MaRTE OS is written in Ada, then even in the case you are not going
   to program Ada applications, you will need the GNAT compiler to
   compile the MaRTE kernel. Installing it is very easy and can be
   done in your own user directory without affecting the rest of the
   system. Each MaRTE OS version has support for a set of AdaCore compiler
   versions. Make sure you are using the right compiler, otherwise the
   MaRTE OS installer will complain.

   Installing an AdaCore GNAT compiler is very simple. Just go to the
   AdaCore website at https://libre.adacore.com/ and download the
   compiler. Then, you have to decompress it and execute a simple
   script.

   For example, for the GNAT-GPL-2016 version execute:

   $ cd $HOME/myapps
   $ tar -zxvf gnat-gpl-2016-x86_64-linux-bin.tar.gz
   $ cd gnat-gpl-2016-x86_64-linux-bin
   $ ./doinstall
   $  Choose a non-standard installation and specify where you want to
      have the compiler (i.e: $HOME/myapps)

   Remember to put the directory where GNAT binaries are located AT
   THE FRONT of your PATH:

   $ export PATH=$HOME/myapps/gnat/bin:$PATH

   For making it permanent you can add the previous command to your shell
   startup script (i.e: $HOME/.bashrc or $HOME/.bash_profile)

   For RPi architecture it is also required the GNAT for ARM (read the
   INSTALL_RPi.txt document sections "Installation.0").

1) Installing MaRTE OS

   1.1) Untar and 'minstall'

   MaRTE OS is very simple to install. You just have to uncompress it
   and run a script. Check that you have the GNAT compiler in front of
   your path ($ echo $PATH) and execute the following commands:

        $ cd $HOME
        $ tar -zxvf marte-version.tar.gz
        $ cd marte
        $ ./minstall

   'minstall' will try to find your GNAT installation path and a make a few
   symbolic links.

   1.2) Compile MaRTE libraries

   After 'minstall' has finished its work it provides the list of
   available architectures (according to the GNAT/GCC installed in
   your system).

   It is convenient to include the 'utils/' directory in your path in
   order to have direct access to MaRTE tools :

        $ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/marte/utils

   To make this change permanent you can add the previous command to
   your shell startup script (i.e: $HOME/.bashrc or
   $HOME/.bash_profile).

   If you are installing a binary version of MaRTE OS you have already
   finished the installation. You can read how to switch between
   architectures bellow in this chapter and jump to section 2 "Check
   your installation with an example".

   If you are installing a source distribution of MaRTE OS the final
   step will be to compile MaRTE OS kernel and libraries. To do it,
   you must set the chosen architecture (using script
   'msetcurrentarch') and compile two libraries:

	- GNAT RTS modified for MaRTE (using script 'mkrtsmarteuc')
	- MaRTE library "libmarte.a" (using script 'mkmarte')

   For example, if you want to compile MaRTE for "linux_lib"
   architecture you should execute:

        $ msetcurrentarch linux_lib
        $ mkrtsmarteuc
        $ mkmarte

   You can do the same for different architectures since in the same
   MaRTE installation it is possible to have several architectures
   copiled and ready to use.

   Once you have compiled all the architectures you want, it is
   possible to switch from one architecture to another using the
   script 'msetcurrentarch':

       $ msetcurrentarch architecture_name

   Examples of use of 'msetcurrentarch' are shown below:

        $ msetcurrentarch linux
        $ msetcurrentarch linux_lib
        $ msetcurrentarch x86 [i386 | pi | pii]
        $ msetcurrentarch rpi

    Notice the architecture "x86" requires and extra parameter (the
    processor):

        - i386: Intel x86 processor. PIT is used as timer and clock.
        - pi: Pentium I. PIT is used as timer and TSC as clock.
        - pii: Pentium II or above. LocalAPIC timer used as timer
               and TSC as clock.

    Note: Sometimes you will want to have several instances of MaRTE OS
    installed on the same system (for example to have several versions of
    MaRTE OS) leading to a collision when using the directories in the
    $PATH variable. One possibility is to have them with different names
    and make a symbolic link to know which one you want to use at the moment.
    (The same goes for the GNAT compilers). For example, in the following
    tree "marte" is a the symbolic link (ln -s realmarte marte):

        |-- marte -> marte-13Jan2009/
        |-- marte-22Aug2008/
        `-- marte-13Jan2009/

2) Check your installation with an example

    At this point, a working MaRTE OS environment should exist in your
    host. In order to check it you can compile an example from the MaRTE OS
    'example/' directory.

        $ cd $HOME/marte/examples
        $ mgcc hello_world_c.c (for a C application)
        $ mgnatmake hello_world.adb (for an Ada application)
        $ mg++ hello_world_cpp.cc (for a C++ application)

    The compilation and linking processes should be accomplished
    without any error, and the resulting application 'a.out' should
    have been created. You can use 'mgcc' with the same options as 'gcc'.
    For instance to set the output path and filename for the application you
    could use the `-o' option.

        $ mgcc hello_world_c.c -o mprogram

    For more information about building, running, and debugging user
    applications please chech the next sections and the documentation
    in the MaRTE OS website (http://marte.unican.es)

3) Running the application.

   (For RPi architecture go to INSTALL_RPi.txt section "Installation.3")

    If you have chosen linux or linux_lib as the architecture you can run the
    program as any other linux application:

        $ ./mprogram

    For the x86 architecture there are several ways of running the 'mprogram'
    we just built in the previous section. You can use your own PC by adding
    it to your GRUB menu, you can use an emulator or you can use a target PC.
    These possibilities are well explained in the tutorials section at the
    MaRTE OS website (http://marte.unican.es/). 

    For example, using the QEMU emulator (version 0.12.3 or above) a
    'mprogram' compiled for the x86 architecture can be executed using the
    following command:

        $ qemu -kernel mprogram

4) Debugging the application

   (For RPi architecture go to INSTALL_RPi.txt section "Installation.4")

    If you have chosen linux or linux_lib as the architecture you can debug
    the program as any other linux application:

        $ cd $HOME/marte
        $ mgnatmake -g hello_world.adb -o mprogram
                    or
        $ mgcc -g hello_world_c.c -o mprogram
        $ gdb mprogram

    For the x86 architecture if you are using a target PC you can debug it
    through a Serial Port cable. Edit 'hello_world.adb' or 'hello_world_c.c',
    uncomment the lines labeled as "For Debugging" and recompile the program
    with the -g flag:

        $ mgnatmake -g hello_world.adb -o mprogram
                    or
        $ mgcc -g hello_world_c.c -o mprogram

    Now your program gets blocked before displaying the hello world message.
    Run 'gdb':

        $ gdb mprogram

    The connection with the target is performed executing the following
    gdb command:

        (gdb) target remote /dev/ttyS0

    Where '/dev/ttyS0' is the device file for the serial port 1. After
    this you should get a message like this:

    Remote debugging using /dev/ttyS0
    main () at hello_world.c:25
    25        printf("\nHello, I'm a C program running on the MaRTE OS.\n\n");

    For the x86 architecture if you are using the QEMU emulator as a target PC
    you can use its built-in debugging capabilities. (More in the tutorials
    section):

        $ qemu -kernel mprogram -s -S &
        $ gdb mprogram
        (gdb) target remote localhost:1234
        (gdb) break main
        (gdb) cont
